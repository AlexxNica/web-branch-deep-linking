# Branch Metrics Web SDK

This README outlines the functionality of the Branch Metrics Web SDK, and how to easily incorporate it into a web app.

Live demo: [https://cdn.branch.io/example.html](https://cdn.branch.io/example.html)

## Overview

The Branch Web SDK provides an easy way to interact with the Branch API on your website or web app. It requires no frameworks, and is only ~7K gzipped.

To use the Web SDK, you'll need to first initialize it with your API key found in your [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings). You'll also need to register when your users login with `setIdentity`, and when they logout with `logout`.

Once initialized, the Branch Web SDK allows you to create and share links with a banner, over SMS, or your own methods. It also offers event tracking, access to referrals, and management of credits.

## Installation

### Requirements

This SDK requires native browser Javascript and has been tested in all modern browsers with sessionStorage capability. No 3rd party libraries are needed to make use of the SDK as is it 100% native Javascript.

### Browser Specific Support
| Chrome | Firefox | Safari |     IE     |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
|    &#10004;   |    &#10004;    |   &#10004;    |  9, 10, 11 |

### API Key

You will need to create a [Branch Metrics app](http://branch.io) to obtain your app_key.

### Quick Install

#### Manual installation

_Be sure to replace `APP-KEY` with your actual app key found in your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings)._

```html
<script type="text/javascript">

	// INSERT INIT CODE

	branch.init('APP-KEY', function(err, data) {
    	// callback to handle err or data
	});
</script>
```

#### Bower or npm installation

If you use Bower or npm, you can run `bower install branch-sdk` or `npm install branch-sdk` respectively to get the SDK.

#### Common.JS and RequireJS compatibility

In addition to working as a standalone library, the Branch SDK works great in CommonJS environments (browserify, webpack) as well as RequireJS environments (RequireJS/AMD). Just `require('branch')` or `define(['branch'], function(branch) { ... });` to get started!
